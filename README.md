# Mini-Banck-Project
This project is a simple project that concentrates mainly on doing simple activities and transactions in the bank like deleting, updating, adding, and showing client records, also it has some transaction processes like deposit, Withrow, and show total balance.  It is one of the first projects I built in my early stages of learning programming.
